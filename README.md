# ETL Pipeline Project

Work in Progress: This project is actively evolving. More ETL steps and visualizations coming soon!

This project demonstrates a complete **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** workflow using **Python** and **SQL** to process data from CSV sources:

- **Extract:** Load CSV data
- **Transform:** Clean, validate, and standardize data for analytics
- **Load:** Prepare data for reporting and dashboarding in a compliant and efficient way

---

### Key Features
(In Progress)
- Modular and reproducible **ETL pipeline** for raw â†’ processed data
- Includes **basic data validation** (duplicates, nulls, type checks)
- **Easily extensible** for cloud storage or warehouse integration
- All demo data is **anonymized and MIT-licensed** for public use

### Tech Stack
(In Progress)
- **Python** (...)
- **SQL** (for transformations & validation)
- **Git & Virtual Environments** for reproducibility
- ...
